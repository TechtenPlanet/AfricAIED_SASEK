<s>[INST] <<SYS>> System prompt <</SYS>> NSMQ Question: Obligatory exchange is a type osmotic exchange that take place between a fish and its environment which is usually in response to physical factors over which the fish has little or no physiological control. Mention one of the four main factors that affect obligatory exchanges
/INST Gradient between the Extracellular Compartment and the Environment
The greater the ionic difference between the body fluid and external medium, the greater the tendency for net diffusion to low concentrations. Thus, a bony fish in a sea water is affected by the problem of losing water into the hypertonic sea water.
Surface/Volume Ratio
Generally the animal with small body size desiccates (or hydrates) more rapidly than a larger animal of the same shape.
Permeability of the Gills
Fish gills are necessarily permeable to water and solutes as they are the main site of exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the blood and the water. Active transport of salts also takes place in the gills.
Feeding
Fishes take water and solute along with the feeding. A gill takes high quantity of salt than water at the time of feeding on seashore invertebrates, these fishes, therefore, must have some special device to excrete excess of salt. However, a freshwater fish ingests large amount of water than salt and thus needs special means of salt conservation..

<s>[INST] <<SYS>> System prompt <</SYS>> NSMQ Question: What happens in the kidney tubules when the concentration of solutes in the blood rises above a certain level?
