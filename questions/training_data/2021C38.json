Active transport of salts also takes place in the gills.\nFeeding\nFishes take water and solute along with the feeding. A gill takes high quantity of salt than water at the time of feeding on seashore invertebrates, these fishes, therefore, must have some special device to excrete excess of salt. However, a freshwater fish ingests large amount of water than salt and thus needs special means of salt conservation."
